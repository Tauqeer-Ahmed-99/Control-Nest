# Control Nest

**Control Nest** is the mobile app companion to **AutoPi Hub**, designed to provide an intuitive interface for managing and automating your home devices. It allows users to control devices, create rooms, and automate tasks from their mobile devices.

## AutoPi Hub Integration

Control Nest works with the **AutoPi Hub**, which is a Python-based home automation system running on a Raspberry Pi. To fully utilize Control Nest, you need to have the **AutoPi Hub** server set up.
